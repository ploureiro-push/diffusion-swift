 The topic type determines the type of the data values a topic publishes to
 subscribers.

 ### Source Topics

 Most topics are source topics. The characteristics of each type of source
 topic are summarized in the following table.

 | Topic type                       | State                         | Data type                                         |
 | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
 | #PTDiffusionTopicType_String     | Single scalar value.          | String.                                           |
 | #PTDiffusionTopicType_Int64      | Single scalar value.          | 64-bit integer.                                   |
 | #PTDiffusionTopicType_Double     | Single scalar value.          | Double precision floating point number.           |
 | #PTDiffusionTopicType_Binary     | Single scalar value.          | Arbitrary binary data.                            |
 | #PTDiffusionTopicType_RecordV2   | Single composite value.       | #PTDiffusionRecordV2 &ndash; Diffusion-specific data type. A list of records, each composed of field values, with an optional schema. |
 | #PTDiffusionTopicType_JSON       | Single composite value.       | #PTDiffusionJSON, backed by CBOR-format binary.   |
 | #PTDiffusionTopicType_TimeSeries | Append-only log of events.    | #PTDiffusionTimeSeriesEvent containing a value of a \link #PTDiffusionDataTypes well-known data type\endlink. |


 ###Routing Topics (deprecated)

 A PTDiffusionTopicType_Routing topic can have a different source topic for each
 subscription.

 Routing topics republish values from source topics. The data type is
 inherited from the source topic.

 Routing topics are deprecated in favor of {@link PTDiffusionSessionTreesFeature Session Trees}.

 @see PTDiffusionTopicSpecification

 @since 5.6
 */
typedef NS_ENUM(NSUInteger, PTDiffusionTopicType) {
    /**
     Routing Topic.

     A topic that can reference different source topics for different sessions.

     Each subscription to a routing topic is routed to a source topic. Updates
     to the source topic are routed back to the subscriber and appear to come
     from the routing topic.

     The result is that a session may subscribe to a topic which is in reality
     supported by another topic and the mapping of the routing topic to the
     actual topic can be different for each session.

     As an example, you may wish for all sessions to simply subscribe to a
     topic called "Prices" but depending upon the client type the actual topic
     could differ (Prices/Discount, Prices/Standard etc).

     An instance of this topic may map any number of sessions to any number of
     different source topics.

     From the point of view of a session subscribing to such a topic, a
     routing topic appears to be a normal topic but it has no state of its own
     and cannot be updated.

     The mapping of sessions to source topics is performed by a control client
     session using the Subscription Control feature. When a session subscribes
     to the routing topic the control client is requested to provide the topic
     that the client is to be subscribed to. If there is no control client
     available to handle subscriptions at the time a session subscribed, the
     session will not be subscribed to the topic.

     Alternatively, the routing can be determined by a user-written Java class
     (deployed on the server) which will be invoked to define the mapping of
     the topic to another data topic when a session subscribes.

     When a source topic is removed that is mapped to from a routing topic then
     any session that were mapped to that source topic will be unsubscribed from
     the routing topic.

     {@link PTDiffusionSessionTreesFeature Session Trees} feature should be used in their place.

     A time series is a sequence of events. Each event contains a value and has
     server-assigned metadata comprised of a sequence number, timestamp, and
     author.

     A time series topic allows sessions to access a time series that is
     maintained by the server. A time series topic has an associated event data
     type that determines the type of value associated with each event.

     ### Retained range

     The [PTDiffusionTopicSpecification timeSeriesSubscriptionRange] property
     configures the range of historic events retained by a time series topic.
     If the property is not specified, a time series topic will retain the ten
     most recent events.

     ### Subscription range

     The [PTDiffusionTopicSpecification timeSeriesSubscriptionRange] property
     configures a time series topic to send a range of historic events from the
     end of the time series to new subscribers. This is a convenient way to
     synchronize new subscribers without requiring the use of a range query.

     By default, new subscribers will be sent the latest event if delta streams
     are enabled and no events if delta streams are disabled.

     ### Mandatory properties

     The [PTDiffusionTopicSpecification timeSeriesEventValueType] property must
     be provided when creating a time series topic.
